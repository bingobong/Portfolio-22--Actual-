        <p>Hi people, welcome to my website! My name is Gayatri Padmanabhan. I am currently a sophomore at Cab Calloway School of the Arts, majoring in Communication Arts. 
            I have an interest in the sciences, specificially biology, chemistry, and anatomy. I am also SOMEWHAT versed in web design, video editing, and graphic design. 
            Outside of school, I like to dance, sing, cook, play the violin and piano, tutor annoying ungrateful children, and bother my friends (Maya Perry sucks btw). 
            I have no clue what to say here, I have 2 cats and cry a lot. Thanks for visiting and feel free to look around :)))!!!!</p>
